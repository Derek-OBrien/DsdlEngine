Setting up Android Enviroment:

1: Set up android ndk, ant, sdk, Java home, eclispe
2: download SDL source library and extract android_project
3: this is a base set up of an android project now it is time to add sdl librarys and set up the Android.mk and build properties
4: Download source of sdl extension librarys and extract and copy to project-android/jni (create folder for each extension)
5: in jni/src edit Android.mk to include each library added and change the SDL_PATH
6: in same file add all cpp files for building( will introduce wildcard later to auto add)
7: Set target android platfrom to android-15 for ant to use
8: Create package folders and add the premade java file to interface with SDL 
9: to make the application use our package and name edit the AndroidManifest.xml and change package and android:name settings
10: change strings.xml to change name of app 
11: game assets must be stored in an assets folder in the root of the android project. create this folder and place any assets inside
12: enable STL so the project can use C++ by by opening the Application.mk and adding line "APP_STL=stlport_static"

Setting up Win32 Enviroment:
1: Create project select sources and select main file in _classes folder at root to use it as entry point.
